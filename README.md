# 👋 Hi, I'm Desmond Kofi Boateng

My name is Desmond Kofi Boateng and I am a PhD Student at **Boise State University**.  
I am currently working on research regarding **kernel methods in operator learning** and **neural networks used to solve parametric PDEs**.

Previously, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Cape Wesley Consulting**, where I:
- Built high-level **web scrapers** for large-scale data collection
- Developed **machine learning models** for **NLP text classification**
- Explored solutions using **computer vision** and **image processing techniques**
